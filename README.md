# PyBer_Analysis

*Overview of the analysis:

V. Isualize has asked us to use Matplotlib to visualize PyBer data. First, we need to breakdown ride data into city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). Then we need to find the total drivers, total fares, avg fare and avg fare per driver for each city type. Finally, we needed to chart the total fare for each cty type data for V. Isalize .


**Results:

From the data tables below we see that Urban centers have the highest number of drivers, who give the most rides and brings in the most highest total fares. However, each urban driver collects the lowest average fare. Rural drives have the inverse of this trend with the fewest total drivers, total rides and lowest total fares; with the highest avg fare per ride. The suburban trend lies inbetween.

Driver Count 
Rural         78

Urban       2405

Avg Driver Fare 
Rural       55.486282
Suburban    39.502714
Urban       16.571468

Avg Fare
Rural       34.623440
Suburban    30.970128
Urban       24.525772

Total Fares
type
Rural        4327.93
Suburban    19356.33
Urban       39854.38

Total Rides 
Rural        125.0
Suburban     625.0
Urban       1625.0





***Summary:

From the data summarized above it is clear that urban centers bring in the highest revenue and rural areas the lowest. However, it is unclear from our information on how Pyber can capitalize on this data without knowing more. Assuming that the company has a higher profit margin when they average driver fare is higher then it would make sense to decrease the number of drivers in urban centers. If the demand for rides was still high and the supply of drivers would low that would lead to an increased avg in the driver fare. They may be able to optimize this trend during the season by preimpentivley changing the total number of drivers during higher volume months like Feb and Apr.
